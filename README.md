Monte Carlo Simulation Project
This project demonstrates the application of Monte Carlo simulations, a powerful statistical tool used for modeling and simulating complex systems influenced by random variables. The simulation helps estimate probable outcomes by running thousands of trials and analyzing statistical patterns.
Introduction
Monte Carlo simulations provide a means of solving problems that are analytically intractable by employing repeated random sampling. This project is designed to showcase how Monte Carlo methods can be applied to a specific problem (e.g., estimating probabilities, calculating integrals, or simulating systems with randomness).
Features
Random Number Generation: Simulates various scenarios with random sampling.
Flexible Setup: Adjustable parameters such as the number of trials and sampling distributions.
Data Visualization: Graphs and plots are generated to show the distribution of results.
Accurate Statistical Analysis: Uses a large number of trials to provide reliable approximations.
Monte Carlo Method
How it Works
The Monte Carlo method follows these key steps:

Define the problem: Express the system or problem in probabilistic terms.
Generate random inputs: Use random number generators to produce possible outcomes.
Simulate: Run many trials, simulating the random variables over and over.
Aggregate results: Calculate averages, probabilities, or distributions based on the simulated outcomes.
This approach is useful for problems where direct analytical solutions are complex or impossible.

Applications
Some popular applications of the Monte Carlo method include:

Risk analysis in finance
Physics simulations
Estimate of Pi
Optimization problems
Forecasting complex systems
